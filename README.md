Useful Tips
Video formats: MP4/MOV are safest for compatibility.

Storage: Trimmed videos save to a temp directory by default (can be changed in TrimmerService).

Common fixes:

Run flutter pub upgrade

Use flutter run --verbose for debugging

Check for package updates on pub.dev

Note: video_trimmer uses FFmpeg internally, which may increase app size.
